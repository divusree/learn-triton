# Learn Triton

I am currently learning Triton and I am brushing up on C to read CUDA code. It is a stretch goal to code in CUDA and do thread level task assignments, so the scope is limited to Triton. 

## Kernels

- `addition/addition.py`: Has 1D and 2D matrix addition `add_1D` and `add_2D` respectively.
- `multiplication/multiplication.py`: ongoing - currently contains a kernel for 1D vector accumulated sum `dot_sum`. will be using this for dot product after elementwise multiplication.
