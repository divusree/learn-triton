# Learn Triton

I am currently learning Triton and I am brushing up on C to read CUDA code. It is a stretch goal to code in CUDA and do thread level task assignments, so the scope is limited to Triton. 

## Kernels

- `addition/addition.py`: Has 1D and 2D matrix addition `add_1D` and `add_2D` respectively. 
- `addition/sumvec.py`: adds all the elements in a 1D vector with `sum1D`.
- `multiplication/multiplication.py`: performs matrix multiplication between 2 2D matrices with `matmul`.
